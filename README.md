# hello-world
TBD 

Well, hello. 

I was introduced to the world of computer science officially (by that I mean I listened to the first lecture) and literally 3 hours ago. 

This is quite new and exiting for someone who mostly spent their academic life (soon to be 3rd year undergrad student here) learning about Life Sciences.

I love Immunology, very much interested in Psychology, and facinated with the nature and animals and specifically a folded-eared grey cat which is snoring next to me at the moment.  

Sleepily yours,
